# moonlights-transcribe

This is the script to run live transcription on multiple Twitch Streams!

For each stream you want to transcribe, create a new key:value pair in the "streams" dictionary with the streamer's username

Follow the [Database Setup README](https://github.com/jafrizzell/moonlights-transcribe/blob/master/DDL.MD) to create the necessary database for this.
